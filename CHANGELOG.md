## [Unreleased]

## [v3.0.0] - 2025-04-03

- Improved configuration handling: ENV varibales takes priority over config file variables. [#202](https://github.com/cloudamqp/amqproxy/pull/202)

- â€‹Resolved a deadlock occurring when running lavinmqperf throughput against LavinMQ via AMQProxy, caused by fibers holding locks while attempting to write to blocked socket. [#200](https://github.com/cloudamqp/amqproxy/pull/200)

## [v2.0.4] - 2024-11-25

- Bugfix: Treat all frames as heartbeats

## [v2.0.3] - 2024-10-23

- Added config option term_client_close_timeout and cli option --term-client-close-timeout to set how long to wait for clients to close their connections before sending Close when amqproxy receives a TERM signal.
- Added a HTTP health check on http://listen_address:http_port/healthz
- Added metrics on http://listen_address:http_port/metrics
- Don't log when a client just opens and closes a TCP connection
- Compile static binary


## [v2.0.2] - 2024-08-25

- Compile with Crystal 1.13.2, fixes a memory leak in Hash.

## [v2.0.1] - 2024-07-11

- Return unused memory faster to the OS using GC_UNMAP_THRESHOLD=1 in Dockerfile and systemd service file
- Compile with Crystal 1.13.0, fixes a potential memory leak in Log

## [v2.0.0] - 2024-06-17

- Main difference against v1.x is that channels are pooled, multiple client channels are shared on a single upstream connection, dramatically decreasing the number of upstream connections needed
- IPv6 addresses in brackets supported in upstream URL (eg. amqp://[::1])
- Otherwise unchanged from v2.0.0-rc.8

## [v2.0.0-rc.8] - 2024-05-12

- Allow large client frame sizes, but split body frames to client if smaller than upstream frame size, to support large Header frames

## [v2.0.0-rc.7] - 2024-05-12

- Send all GetOk response frames in one TCP packet

## [v2.0.0-rc.6] - 2024-05-11

- Bugfix: Send Connection.Close-ok to client before closing TCP socket
- Bugfix: Pass Channel.Close-ok down to client

## [v2.0.0-rc.5] - 2024-05-11

- Bugfix: negotiate frame_max 4096 for downstream clients

## [v2.0.0-rc.4] - 2024-05-11

- Bufix: Only send channel.close once, and gracefully wait for closeok
- Buffer publish frames and only send full publishes as RabbitMQ doesn't support channel.close in the middle of a publish frame sequence
- Optimization: only flush socket buffer after a full publish sequence, not for each frame

## [v2.0.0-rc.3] - 2024-05-09

- Never reuse channels, even publish only channels are not safe if not all publish frames for a message was sent before the client disconnected
- Don't log normal client disconnect errors
- Don't allow busy connection to dominate, Fiber.yield every 4k msgs
- --term-timout support, wait X seconds after signal TERM and then forefully close remaining connections
- Always negotate 4096 frame_max size, as that's the minimum all clients support

## [v2.0.0-rc.2] - 2024-03-09

- Heartbeat support on the client side
- Connection::Blocked frames are passed to clients
- On channel errors correctly pass closeok to upstream server

## [v2.0.0-rc.1] - 2024-02-19

- Rewrite of the proxy where Channels are pooled rather than connections. When a client opens a channel it will get a channel on a shared upstream connection, the proxy will remap the channel numbers between the two. Many client connections can therefor share a single upstream connection. Upside is that way fewer connections are needed to the upstream server, downside is that if there's a misbehaving client, for which the server closes the connection, all channels for other clients on that shared connection will also be closed.
